		Royale513's Mission
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>
			At a glance our mission is as follows...
		</strong>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		It is the desire of Royale513 to become a safe place for young people to learn communication skills, leadership qualities, and just have a great time being a part of something bigger than themselves. Clans themselves give game like Clash Royale a sense of community, add additional leveling options, and introduce co-operative game types. The one thing they currently lack, in our opinion, is structural tools to aid in clan leadership functions. A member of a clan cannot rely on the game's save data or official website to provide any sort of progression tracking outside of said user'scurrent standings for donations and trophies.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
		Some of our more specific objectives are listed below:
		</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Provide better visibility of clan member's contribution to the community through weekly logging of each user's donations
			</li>
			<li>
				Encourage growth of all clan members through weekly logging of trophy ranking
			</li>
			<li>
				Provide similar experiences for other clans and their leaders through the sharing of our web site's template
			</li>
		</ul>
